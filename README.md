[![NPM Package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@rlxyz/contracts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@rlxyz/contracts)

**A library for ERC721 development built on an optimzed contract standard** 

 * Wrapper around [ERC721A](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A) by Chiru-Labs.
 * Incorporates public sale functionality
 * Incorporates pre-sale functionality that utilises merkle roots
 * Incorporates Promtoion NFTs to be minted

## Overview

### Installation

```console
$ yarn add @rlxyz/contracts
```

RLXYZ Contracts features a stable API which means your contracts won't break unexpectedly when upgrading to a newer minor version.

### Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@rlxyz/contracts/RhapsodyCreator.sol";

contract Example is RhapsodyCreator {
    constructor(bytes32 _presaleMerkleRoot)
        RhapsodyCreator("Example", "EXAM", _presaleMerkleRoot, 60, 10, 5, 0.05 ether)
    {}
}
```

_If you're new to smart contract development, head to [Developing Smart Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts) to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts._

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources, nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
